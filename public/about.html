<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
<p>I'm Asude Kara, a 19 year old sophomore at Kadir Has University, studying Management Information Systems (MIS).
  I'm passionate about the intersection of technology, business and problem-solving, especially through coding and digital tools.</p>

<p>Beyond academics, I'm an active member of my university's sailing team, both as an athlete and as a part of the KHas Sailing club's executive board, where I manage social media and communications.
  Sailing has taught me resilience, discipline and team-work skills that I carry into every area of my life.
</p>

<p>I also have a strong interest in traveling, discovering new places and embracing new experiences that broaden my perceptive.
  I aim to continously develop myself, expand my knowledge and apply what I learn in my, both academic and professional, life. </p>
